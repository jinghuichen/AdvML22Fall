# IST 597: Adversarial Machine Learning 


## Overview

Machine learning techniques are prevalent in solving real-world problems, however, they are also found to be vulnerable to malicious adversaries. This has raised serious security concerns and trustworthy issues in the current machine learning systems. In this course, students will learn about understanding the risks posed by adversaries to the current machine learning systems, as well as designing more advanced defense techniques to mitigate those risks. 

This course is focused on helping students explore new research directions and applications in Adversarial Machine Learning. As part of this focus, students will understand the vulnerabilities of different machine learning algorithms or improve the current machine learning model robustness through a series of readings and projects.
 

## Prerequisites
This course requires the knowledge of an undergrad level machine learning course, basic background on linear algebra and calculus.

## Paper Presentation 
- Each student will present 2 papers for a specific topic. Students need to sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EZ0PzciWw3uFncb5-K5oR24nij3z1L8eD8GQTvl5QCk/edit?usp=sharing) for the presentation before Week 2. 
- Students are expected to prepare the slides by themselves, but the original authors’ slides are allowed to be used with proper citation.
- Students need to upload the slides at least one day before the presentation.
- The presentation quality will take 30% of your grade (contains 5% peer review).

## Paper Reviews 
- Each student will review 2 papers from the piles that other students presented (different from the papers you presented).  
- Each review should contain a basic introduction to the background, drawbacks of prior solutions (if any), proposed problem formulations/analysis and your understanding towards the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method/analysis as well as the possible future directions.
- The review quality will take 15% of your grade.

## Final Project 
- Group is allowed for the final project (with a maximum of 2 people per group). The expectation for a 2-people group will be relatively higher.
- The goal of the course project is to provide the students an opportunity to explore research directions in adversarial machine learning. Therefore, the project should be related to the course content. An expected project include but not limited to
    - A novel and sound solution to an interesting problem
    - Solving an interesting new real-world problem with adversarial machine learning 
    - Thorough theoretical analysis of existing approaches
- The best outcome of the project is a manuscript that is publishable in major machine learning/AI/Security conferences (ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, KDD, ACL, CCS, etc.).
- Incentives: outstanding projects that are publishable on top tier venues (determined by the instructor) can waive the paper reviews. Contact the instructor before the project final presentation if you feel qualified.
- The final project quality will take 50% of your grade.
- **Students cannot use their own published work as the course project.**


## Late Submission Policy
- All reports are due on Thursday at 11:59 pm (EST).
- Students can submit late with the penalty of 25% deduction for every 24 hours late (up to 3 days).
- After 3 days, no more late submission is allowed.
- Extensions can be granted for special cases (email the instructor)


## Mask Policy
Penn State University highly recommend everyone to wear a face mask in all university buildings, including classrooms, regardless of vaccination status. We highly recommend all students to wear a mask appropriately (i.e., covering both your mouth and nose) while you are indoors on campus.  This is to protect your health and safety as well as the health and safety of your classmates, instructor, and the university community.  
 


## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT
Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.
